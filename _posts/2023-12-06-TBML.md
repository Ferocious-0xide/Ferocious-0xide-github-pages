# Don't Overlook the Power of Task-Based Machine Learning
### I enjoyed watching Amazon CTO Werner Vogels' keynote and his reference to as “good old-fashioned AI”. It was refreshing to hear an industry leader talking about AI that is not a large language model.
In the last year, the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been swept up in the craze of Large Language Models (LLMs). These sophisticated models, such as GPT-3+, have demonstrated remarkable language generation capabilities, enabling them to perform tasks ranging from writing essays to generating creative content. While the LLM trend has certainly revolutionized the field, it's crucial not to overlook the significance of Task-Based Machine Learning (TBML).

LLMs, with their immense pre-trained knowledge and natural language understanding, have become the darlings of the AI community. Their ability to comprehend and generate human-like text has led to breakthroughs in various applications, from chatbots to content creation. However, the hype surrounding LLMs should not overshadow the unique advantages offered by TBML. Task-Based Machine Learning involves training models to perform specific tasks, focusing on the practical application of AI in solving real-world problems. Unlike the broad capabilities of LLMs, TBML is tailored to address specific challenges, making it a powerful tool in industries where precision and task-oriented outcomes are paramount.

One of the key advantages of TBML is its efficiency. By honing in on a particular task, these models can be fine-tuned to deliver highly accurate results with less computational power. This efficiency is particularly crucial in applications such as healthcare diagnostics, financial fraud detection, and industrial automation, where precision and speed are non-negotiable. TBML fosters interpretability and transparency. Understanding how a model reaches a specific conclusion is essential for building trust in AI systems, especially in sectors like healthcare and finance, where decisions have significant consequences. TBML models, designed for specific tasks, often have more transparent decision-making processes compared to the complex inner workings of LLMs. LLMs often require vast amounts of data for pre-training, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, TBML can achieve impressive results with smaller, more focused datasets. This makes it a practical choice for industries that may not have access to massive amounts of labeled data. Consider this use case for a virtual medical assistant.
- Task Identification:
  
  LLM's Role: Use a Large Language Model, such as GPT-3, to handle natural language interactions. The LLM can understand and generate human-like responses to user queries related to medical information, appointment scheduling, and general health advice.
  TBML's Role: Implement a Task-Based Machine Learning model for specific healthcare tasks. For instance, use a TBML model to recognize and extract key information from patient queries, such as symptoms, medical history, and appointment preferences.
- Appointment Scheduling:
  
  LLM's Role: The LLM can engage in natural language conversations with users, understand appointment requests, and provide confirmation details. It can also handle cancellations or rescheduling queries.
  TBML's Role: Implement a task-specific model to manage the appointment scheduling process efficiently. This TBML model can integrate with the clinic's scheduling system, ensuring accuracy and adherence to available time slots.
- Medical Information Retrieval:
  
  LLM's Role: Leverage the LLM to answer general medical queries. Users can inquire about symptoms, common illnesses, or general health advice, and the LLM can provide informative and contextually relevant responses.
  TBML's Role: Develop a TBML model for more specific medical information retrieval. For instance, the TBML model can be trained to retrieve detailed information about specific medical conditions, treatment options, or medication details from a curated database.
- Symptom Triage:
  
  LLM's Role: Use the LLM for initial symptom triage by asking users about their symptoms and providing general advice. The LLM can guide users based on common symptoms and suggest whether they should seek immediate medical attention or schedule an appointment.
  TBML's Role: Implement a TBML model for more nuanced symptom analysis. The TBML model can consider additional patient history information and make more refined recommendations, helping to prioritize cases based on urgency.
- Integration and Collaboration:
  
  LLM and TBML Collaboration: Combine the outputs of the LLM and TBML models to provide a comprehensive user experience. The LLM handles natural language understanding and generation, while the TBML model ensures task-specific accuracy and efficiency.

While LLMs dominate headlines and research papers, it's important to recognize that TBML has not lost its relevance. In fact, the synergy between LLMs and TBML can lead to groundbreaking advancements. By integrating the strengths of both approaches, we can create AI systems that combine the broad understanding of language with the precision and efficiency of task-oriented models. The marriage of these two approaches holds the key to unlocking the full potential of AI, offering solutions that are not only linguistically adept but also finely tuned to address the specific challenges of our evolving world.
